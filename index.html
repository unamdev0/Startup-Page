			<p class="quote">“In our case, there was no business without the site! Coders Media was the only company that within the first meeting made me feel very confident and comfortable that they understood and could produce what we envisioned. It’s been a terrific experience working with them. I have never had to ask twice for answers and when delivered, they always made sense! The finished product is far superior than I imagined!”</p>
